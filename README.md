# NBA Injury Risk

This code was written as part of my individual project for the [Insight Data Science](http://www.insightdatascience.com) post-doctoral training fellowship over a period of three weeks (August/September 2014). The intent of this project was to highlight certain skills related to the field of data science and to gain experience working with publicly available data. All analyses were done using open-source software packages (Python, MySQL).
